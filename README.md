## Introduction

As preparation for my upcoming postdoctoral venture at MSKCC, or the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, I spent a few months studying and implementing various image encoder learning techniques that would leverage the vast amount of image data available at MSKCC upon my arrival. In the following, I will describe the contents in this repo.
